# Introduction

In this paper, we seek to implement a logistic regression in order to estimate the probability that FC Barcelona, winner of the 2022-2023 LaLiga, win a game given that a game is Home or Away, the amount of possession they held, who the captain was between one of Sergio Busquets, Marc-André ter Stegen, Sergi Roberto, and Gerard Piqué, as well as what day of the week the game was played.
